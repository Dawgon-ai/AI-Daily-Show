# Findings & Discoveries (findings.md)

## Research
- **Sources**: Ben's Bites, AI Rundown (Newsletters). Need to find their web archive URLs for scraping.
- **Persistence**: Using local storage/file system initially, Supabase later.

## Constraints
- **Timeframe**: Last 24 hours only (strict filter).
- **Design**: High priority on aesthetics (Animations, interactivity).
